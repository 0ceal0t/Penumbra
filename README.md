# Penumbra

Penumbra is a runtime mod loader for FINAL FANTASY XIV, with a bunch of other useful features baked in:

* No need to back up your install - mods don't touch game files
* Disable and enable mods without restarting the game
* Resolve conflicts between mods by changing mod order
* Files can be edited and are often replicated in-game after a map change or closing and reopening a window

## Current Status
Penumbra, in its current state, is not intended for widespread use. It is mainly aimed at developers and people who don't need their hands held (for now).

We're working towards a 1.0 release, and you can follow it's progress [here](https://github.com/xivdev/Penumbra/projects/1).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, but please make an issue first before writing any code. It's possible what you want to implement is out of scope for this project, or could be reworked so that it would provide greater benefit.

## TexTools Mods
Penumbra has support for some types of TexTools modpacks, however no support will be given. This is aimed as an interim measure while better tooling is developed, but note that there is no ETA for this.

### Why not support TexTools?

Because it sucks. It's slow to use, the workflow is awful and the codebase is so far gone any notable improvements or support for new features would mean throwing out significant portions of the existing codebase.
